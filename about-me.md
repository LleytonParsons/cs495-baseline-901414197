My name is Lleyton Parsons, and I am a junior here in Ball State. 

I have used Java, Python, HTML, and C++. Most of my best work has been with Java on IntelliJ IDEA.
The largest program/project I've worked on is a movie reccomendator that took info from IMDb, but that was a group project. I put my fair share of work into it though.
I feel most comfortable in coding when I am able to provide solutions, even if it is for imporvising or setting up grounds for improvement. But what I feel the most ok doing in coding is making organized structures
and blocks of code that is clear and easy to read. I am also a person that tends to refer to other sources like text books for example.
What I feel the most uncomfortable about is getting stumped for hours and struggling to find the best fix for it.

Nothing feels too overwhelming (at least for now), but if it were something that looms over me during programming it would simply just the possibility of being stumped at times.
