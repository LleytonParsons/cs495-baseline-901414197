My name is Lleyton Parsons, and I am a junior here in Ball State studying Computer Science.

Languages: Java, Python, a little HTML, and C++
Experience: Mostly school project sand assignments.
Largest Project: IMDb movie recommendation program.
Most Confortable: Providing solutions, whether for improvising for setting up grounds for improvement.
Least Comfortable: Being stumped for hours on end.
Concentration: Web and mobile development.

Nothing feels too overwhelming (at least for now), but if it were something that looms over me during programming it would simply just the possibility of being stumped at times.
