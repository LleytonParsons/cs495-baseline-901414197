I rarely ever use AI like ChatGPT, in which the only timmes I have was for
getting information about something related to programming like a function or a method. 

Most other information I get is through thorough research or text book examples/information.
My programming is also a mix of that but also some of my own work. 

I won the award for "Best in Section - Asthetics" in Prof. Largent's annual digital art show,
for my piece "Ideas are Made of Ideas".
